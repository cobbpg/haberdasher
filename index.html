    <p>This game is an entry to
    the <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/10/october-2011-is-slicing/">October
    2011 edition of the Experimental Gameplay Project</a>.</p>

    <p>The Lazy Haberdasher is a relaxed dissection puzzle game, where
    you have to cut up a planar shape and rearrange the pieces to fill
    a given outline.  The relaxation is that pieces might overlap, so
    the area of the solution might be less than that of the starting
    shape.  However, the number of cuts is limited, so use them
    wisely!  Note that you can get more out of a cut by overlapping
    the pieces first.  The name of the game is a reference to
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_puzzle">haberdasherâ€™s
    problem</a>.</p>

    <p>My original intention was to provide more puzzles, but I ended
    up with insufficient time for the project.  All in all, it took
    around a day of effort spread over a week.</p>

    <p>You can drag the pieces with the left mouse button, and rotate
    them by left clicking while pressing shift.  Dragging over the
    background initiates a cutting action; this can be cancelled by
    overlapping the two control points.</p>
