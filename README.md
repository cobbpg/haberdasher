The Lazy Haberdasher -- Experimental Gameplay October 2011 (Slicing)
====================================================================

The Lazy Haberdasher is a relaxed dissection puzzle game, where you have to cut up a planar shape and rearrange the pieces to fill a given outline.  The relaxation is that pieces might overlap, so the area of the solution might be less than that of the starting shape.  However, the number of cuts is limited, so use them wisely!  The name of the game is a reference to the [haberdasherâ€™s problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_puzzle).

You can [play it online here](http://cobbpg.github.com/haberdasher/).

The polygon clipping routines are from [the AS3 port of the Clipper library](https://github.com/Flassari/as3clipper).
